Hi, I’m @RobertKreegier, this is my repo. Have a look around. I feel like I'm writing the intro to my first GeoCities page...

I'm rather new to Git, but I've been coding as a hobby since the 90's. I started out with C/C++ wanting to be the next Carmack,
and ended up taking a hard right at AI, somehow trading off Carmack for Craig Reynolds and landing on idolizing John Conway.

But that was 20+ years ago. Between then and now I made career choices that kept me at home, which means I was never able to go
to college for CS. Regardless, coding is a passion I most often use in whatever occupation that can pay for the bills.

So herein is a collection of fun little projects to satisfy the coding itch. There's a lot of Excel with VBA, as that usually
benefits my current vocation. I've actually taken a liking to that little language that could.

If you want to get a hold of me, my email is rmkreeg@yahoo.com.
